#---- frigate,,,,,
vanidad_cazador,SHIP,"As one of the earliest blueprints retrieved by archaeoengineers from the massive space station orbiting Kristos, the highly maneuverable and powerful Cazador is in high demand from hotshot pilots in the Operation. Prior to the Collapse, the original Vanidad y Afliction Operation used the Cazador as a testbed for its advanced power redirection systems. Despite the best efforts of the Hegemony-linked modern Operation, scientists have been unable to replicate its delicate circuitry, leaving the Cazador as the only known VAO hull capable of freely modifying the power flow of its weapons and propulsion systems. Unfortunately, this comes at the cost of higher-than-normal maintenance requirements that are nevertheless balanced out by its great speed and maneuverability. ",,,
vanidad_forrajeador,SHIP,"The Forrajeador is a neat logistics package wrapped in an efficient defense platform. Although its light weapons complement is unlikely to win a stand-up fight against a specialized combat vessel, the Forrajeador is a capable support ship when needed on the battlefield. The iconic shape of its containers is a bit of an annoyance for port workers in most of the Persean Sector to handle as they don't match standard Domain cargo container dimensions.",,,
vanidad_pazjoya,SHIP,"The Pazjoya is one of the few ""normal"" vessels in use by the VAO, with few of the advanced technologies common to other ships in their lineup. Considered by the modern Operation to be one of the oldest pre-Collapse VAO designs, it is a well-armored, somewhat slow frigate with a powerful forward complement. Primarily in use as support for VAO's more advanced destroyer and cruiser forces, its above-average defense and missile bafflement abilities allow it to protect the flanks of the Operation's fleets with ease.",,,
#---- destroyer,,,,,
vanidad_halcon,SHIP,"Considered by archaeologists to be one of the last VAO ships designed prior to the Gate shutdown, the Halcon is an aggressive skirmisher used to dictate the terms of the battlefield. Its plasma jets allow the Halcon to freely engage and disengage enemies to support its fleet and manipulate the battle lines. Unfortunately, this mobility comes at a price: despite its higher than average armor plating, poor hull integrity and a limited flux pool make the Halcon a poor frontline combatant.",,,
vanidad_ionizador,SHIP,"Boasting significant strike firepower from its oversized weapons mounts, the Ionizador is designed to punch above its weight in short engagements. Advanced turret stabilization systems allow the ship to briefly increase the range and accuracy of its heavy weapons complement, earning it a prized role in the VAO's pirate suppression fleets.



The Ionizador shares a large number of components and design decisions with the common Sunder, suggesting that the original Vanidad y Afliction Operation enjoyed support and funding from starship engineering firms throughout the Domain prior to the Gate collapse.



Crews assigned to this ship often complain about the position of the bridge at the forward bow. However, the bizarre orange crystalline material unique to VAO designs is durable enough to shrug off most weapon hits due to its angular profile and advanced material qualities.",,,
#---- cruiser,,,,,
vanidad_almadena,SHIP,"With a powerful frontal battery, strong defenses, and good mobility, the Almadena-class cruiser is a mainstay of VAO's fleet doctrine. As a support ship in a larger fleet, it is capable of forming a strong, nimble battle line. As the flagship of a smaller fleet, it has the staying power to keep up with the worst the pirates can throw at it.

The Almadena blueprint was recovered from the Debajo Del Sol station and quickly mass-produced once the station's nanoforge was brought back online. Its performance against early threats to the VAO gave it a good reputation, even among ex-Hegemony traditionalists. Unfortunately, without the use of its plasma drive, the ship's engines seem to be forced to operate at a lower efficiency than their specifications should allow them to. All efforts to fix this shortcoming have failed, leading VAO's baffled engineers to theorize that this was done to forcibly minimize maintenance costs.",,,
vanidad_viajero,SHIP,"A standard carrier of VAO design. Useful in an escort role, the Viajero is one of the few ships that fields the Lenador mobile worker, allowing it the flexibility to support salvaging and surveying efforts while also supporting a fleet using its versatile strike mecha.



Unlike other ships in VAO's arsenal, the Viajero design was reverse-engineered from a wreck discovered several kilometers from the main Kristos settlement. With no blueprints to draw from, the post-Collapse VAO determined that the ship was originally designed as a survey vessel whose bays could accommodate the Lenador mobile workers in use by the natives of Kristos. With that in mind, the VAO set about creating a battlecarrier capable of fielding militarized Lenadors in hostile space. The result is the modern Viajero, a striking example of the creativity and resourcefulness of the VAO's technical staff.",,,
vanidad_invasor,SHIP,"With blueprints dated to only a few decades prior to the Collapse, the Invasor is a ship designed entirely around combat. A true battlecarrier, its powerful weapons complement and flux management hardware allow the Invasor to fight toe-to-toe with the enemy while using its strike craft in a support role.

The archaeoengineers of the modern Vanidad y Afliction Operation were perplexed upon discovering the Invasor's blueprint. While most VAO designs gave their vessels enough logistical equipment to sustain themselves on longer missions, the Invasor appears to have been built without any regard for longevity in the field. The current school of thought suggests that the Invasor, despite its evocative name, was designed to defend the VAO from some unknown aggressor. Others theorize that Invasor was not a misnomer, and the VAO engaged other companies and polities for control over territory using massive support flotillas. Whatever the case may be, the Invasor is a mainstay in the fleets of the modern VAO and lives up to its name.",,,
vanidad_cargador,SHIP,"The Cargador is an aggressive phase ship with a system that allows it to project a potent wave of phase-adjacent energy, creating a significant EMP effect using the so-called ""spiral generator"" powering the ship. This ability allows it to prey on vulnerable ships and disable troublesome enemy combatants. It will, however, falter without support as it lacks a strong point defense grid and relies almost entirely on its forward firepower.

The Cargador is the most advanced blueprint found in the decaying station of the Vanidad y Afliction Operation. Archaeoengineers on the station have tried to study the strange device powering the vessel for decades but the advanced, apparently interdimensional power source has no precedent in the Sector and defies analysis. Any modifications made to the vessel's design invariably result in the explosive disassembly of the ship and the destruction of most of the surrounding test equipment. The only conclusive information known about the wave: its low-level phase harmonics are extremely damaging to electronics and solid matter alike. Even shields are not immune to this effect; unlike normal EMP weapons, the phase wave causes hard flux buildup on shields when it hits.

Crewmen native to Kristos speak with an almost religious reverence of the spiral engine powering the ship, possibly due to its striking similarity to the underground reactors illuminating their dark, cramped dwellings. Crewmen native to the Core, unfortunately, have been known to suffer psychologically and physically from prolonged exposure to the device for reasons currently redacted by Hegemony COMSEC. With its high material and personnel maintenance costs, this ship is, for the moment, a rare sight among the VAO's fleet.",,,
vanidad_fisgon,SHIP,"The Fisgon is a large freighter prized for its ability to hide large quantities of goods from impromptu customs inspections. Better armed than a traditional Domain freighter, it is a lackluster combat ship better suited to a support role in small engagements. To facilitate this, it comes equipped with a built-in targeting solution processor to improve its combat performance against flares, fighters, and missiles.





The peculiar cylindrical container pods of the Fisgon seem to be a proprietary design of the pre-Collapse Vanidad y Afliction Operation. Their design is shared by the containers of the smaller Forrajeador and, similarly to the Forrajeador's containers, are universally loathed by dockworkers across the Core due to their poor compliance with Domain-standard docking bays. The curious shape of its containers allows the Fisgon to project an EM jamming field around its cargo, hiding unauthorized goods in the Fisgon's cargo hold from hostile patrols. This feature is currently unavailable on the smaller Forrajeador. Despite this, rumors have surfaced alleging that the engineers studying the sensor baffling field of the Fisgon might be close to replicating this technology.",,,
vanidad_naveExplorar,SHIP,"The Nave Explorar is a small cruiser with a unique anti-fighter weapon. It excell at escort duty, able to clear missiles and other indesirable with ease while supporting with generous angle of fire and a single flight deck. It's main flaw being a subpar speed, especially compared to other VAO ship.",,,
#---- capital,,,,,
vanidad_comandante,SHIP,"The Comandante is the largest ship recovered from the pre-Collapse blueprint datavault on Debajo Del Sol station. It has spectacular forward firepower and surprising mobility for a ship of its size thanks to its temporal shell system and powerful flux grid. Unfortunately, weak hull integrity and armor limit its ability to maintain the front lines in battle, forcing the Comandante to rely on bulkier ships to soak up damage.



Thanks to its unique temporal circuits and high firepower, VAO crews praise the Commandante for its excellent battlefield performance. Once the battle is over, however, those same crews curse its high maintenance requirements and confusing internal structure that requires days of service to restore to top shape. Owing to its unique capabilities, the Comandante has been the target of several industrial espionage attempts by Tri-Tachyon attempting to reverse-engineer its systems. No evidence exists to confirm that Tri-Tachyon has succeeded in these attempts, leading analysts to suggest two plausible reasons for this outcome: Either the VAO has excellent operational security, or the VAO's engineers understand the ship's systems so little that there is nothing to steal.



Historians are unsure as to why such a large ship was designed but never used by Domain military forces. The leading hypothesis suggests that the ship was designed in secret by a rogue sub-faction of the Domain. However, no indication exists as to why that sub-faction decided to arm itself so substantially.",,,
#---- fighter,,,,,
vanidad_abogado_fighter,SHIP,"The Abogado is a multi-purpose fighter able to deal significant damage to strike craft and frigates. Despite its sturdy frame, the Abogado has a hard time overcoming shields on its own due to its beam-centric loadout. While powerful against the armor of ships and strike craft, its miniaturized Estarayo beam is too inaccurate to serve as effective PD, relegating the Abogado to a strike fighter role.



Praised across the Sector as a miracle of weapons engineering, the miniaturized Estarayo uses a dual-barrel system to maintain the same flux efficiency and damage profile of the standard small Estarayo. Unfortunately, its miniaturized beam does not quite possess the punch to breach heavy armor, requiring the Abogado to be supported by heavier bombers for assaults on larger spacecraft.",,,
vanidad_lenador,SHIP,"The Lenador is perhaps the most iconic piece of mining equipment used by the natives of Kristos. Despite its civilian frame, it has been repurposed as a weapon of war, assisting in the forcible deconstruction of enemy vessels as easily as it processes transplutonic ore.



Designed before the Collapse, the Lenador is a ""mobile worker"", or a large mechanized powersuit that uses the commands of its operator to direct the movements and actions of its 20-meter-tall frame. For centuries, they were only used to mine transplutonic ore on the surface of Kristos as a means of maintaining the spiral generator that powers Kristos' main habitat. After Debajo Del Sol was colonized by the post-Collapse VAO, several inventive engineers found that, with small modifications, the Lenador could be repurposed to operate in space as a mobile repair unit. Later on, under pressure from enemies in the Sector, the Lenador was militarized as a way of shoring up the VAO's meager strike capabilities. In the years since, the Lenador's aggressive, destructive nature has allowed it to shine in engagements against larger ships despite its fragile civilian frame.",,,
#---- gun_estarayo,,,,,
vanidad_estarayo_light,WEAPON,"The Estarayo is a beam weapon created by detonating a flux charge inside of the weapon while firing, causing the beam to terminate explosively after reaching a certain distance. The peculiar capacitor mechanism causes the focusing lenses to rattle, however, making the beam quite inaccurate. This version of the Estarayo is intended for use in small weapon mounts and has lower range and damage potential than its standard counterpart.





The official name of the Estrayo's blueprint is listed as Estallido Rayo. VAO's archaeoengineers, unable to find a consistent translation of this name among the natives of Kristos, shortened the name to Estarayo, an easier name for VAO officers to pronounce.  Researchers are amazed at the quantum vacuum self-focusing field that allows the beam to detonate, but its esoteric effects have proven difficult for VAO engineers to replicate in other weapons systems. Curiously, the minimum distance required for the beam to ""explode"" is unaffected by weapon settings, targeting solutions, or any standard range-altering equipment; the blueprint does not indicate any mechanism that can be used to alter the explosion distance of the beam. 

In practice, most crews have dubbed Estarayo beams ""exploding rays"", and many a veteran spacer can tell stories of a beam missing their ship, only for it to suddenly explode behind them. 



The Vanidad y Afliction Operation uses this line of weapon extensively, both to suppress ships trying to vent flux and to clear large groups of enemy fighters. Deceptively deadly and poorly understood, it is one of the most clearance-restricted weapons manufactured by the VAO.",,,

vanidad_laere_small,WEAPON,"The LAERE is a general multipurpose energy weapon. Sporting an EMP effect, it is more powerful against armor compared to similar weapons in its class but suffers from a low rate of fire and poor flux efficiency. This light version of the LAERE is intended for small mounts, with lower damage potential and range than its standard counterpart.



The LAERE seems to be an acronym for some physical phenomenon, but the research data explaining this acronym or what it implied proved unrecoverable. The dual barrel design is widely disliked by maintenance crews, as it does not follow conventional pulse weapon design guidelines despite its similar function. Indeed, the best efforts of post-Collapse scientists have been unable to determine whether it follows the same principles as Domain-standard energy weaponry at all.

vanidad,FACTION,"At some point before the Collapse, the Citlali system was colonized by an upstart faction known as the Vanidad y Afliction Operation. The pre-Collapse VAO created Debajo Del Sol, a large station orbiting the frozen world of Kristos, as a base from which they could mine the valuable resources on the planet using highly advanced, proprietary technology. Unfortunately, the Operation's lack of self-sufficiency led to its downfall after the collapse as food ran out on the station and the population retreated to the mining outpost on Kristos.



During the Second AI War, a disgruntled Hegemony officer named Alejandro Valdovinos discovered the dormant space station around Kristos. The pre-Collapse VAO's decivilized survivors were discovered on the planet below, eking out a harsh living on the frozen world alongside the massive, churning machinery placed there before the Gate shutdown. Sensing a chance for personal advancement, he reactivated the station and forced the natives of Kristos to restart the station's dormant nanoforge. He then directed the scientists and engineers of his fleet to begin tech-mining Kristos and Debajo Del Sol to retrieve all of the former Operation's blueprints and scientific advancements. Proclaiming the start of the new Vanidad y Afliction Operation, Valdovinos began to mass-manufacture the tech-mined VAO designs, rapidly increasing his power base. Despite his new faction's reliance on imports of fuel and other provisions, the power of its rediscovered warships has forced the Hegemony to grant the VAO a measure of independence. So long as Valdovinos does not act against the interests of his former employer, VAO has the privilege to do as it wishes with Citlali's natural and human resources.



Time has passed since the early days of the new Vanidad y Afliction Operation, however. While the elite, living in the restored Debajo Del Sol station, are content with their affiliation to the Hegemony, the natives, still mostly living underground in the life support domes of Kristos, have begun to desire independence from their foreign overlords. The dream of establishing themselves on a more pleasant planet and the desire to reclaim their technological birthright within the datavaults of Debajo Del Sol have led several native groups to defy the new VAO and its Hegemony backers.",,,
