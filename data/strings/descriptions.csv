vanidad_planet_kristos,CUSTOM,"A cold wasteland with surprisingly large ressources deposit. The planet was not meant to be terraformed and the Vanidad y Afliction Operation installed large underground habitat to give it a measure of independance. With access to a functioning if quickly damaged nanoforge, this allowed it to survive the collapse.",,,
vanidad_planet_arida,CUSTOM,"Not a very prolific world. Original settlers did not survive the collapse, but it was resettled once contact was reestablished with the sector. Current colonization effort mostly focus on extracting ressources that would be unavailable should the survival habitats of Krystos fail.",,,
