#---- frigate,,,,,
vanidad_cazador,SHIP,"One of the early blueprint retrieved by archeoengineer from the massive space station  orbiting Kristo. The peculiar engine disposion allow it to reach surprising speed and agility. It is expensive to make and to maintain, but it is desired by those that desire speed and firepower.",,,
vanidad_forrajeador,SHIP,"The Forrajeador is a neat logistic package wrapped in an efficient defense platform. It is unlikely to win by itself against the more dedicated frigate, it is armed enought to justify is presence in small engagment. The iconic shape of the container, betraying the source of the blueprint, are a bit of an annoyance for port workers in most of the persean sector as they do not match standard domain specification.",,,
vanidad_pazjoya,SHIP,"This frigate is a nice all-rounder. Captain liek to use it as an escort, but its gun mount allow it to do grievous damage.",,,
#---- destroyer,,,,,
vanidad_halcon,SHIP,"An aggressive destroyer frame, seemingly one of the last designs developed by VAO Project before the shutdown of the Gates. Prized by its captains for the ability to engage most enemies at its own terms due to its system. Its defensive capabilities are quite mediocre with barely any weapons covering its vulnerable engines and sides.",,,
vanidad_ionizador,SHIP,"The Ionizador is a respectable opponent on the battlefield, not because of sheer amount of firepower it brings, but due to large energy mount with extremely good coverage as well as decent secondary mounts. Its system hypercharges weapon mountings and internal stabilizers, allowing the vessel to increase its weapon range for short time, which has been an end of many pirate vessels among others.



The Ionizador shares a large number of components and engineering decisions with the widespread Sunder, giving credibility to the opinion that other corporations from the Domain of Man supported whatever entity was responsible for the VAO Project. 



Crews assigned to this ship often complain about the position of the bridge at the very front of the ship, yet the bizarre orange crystalline material unique to VAO designs is durable enough to shrug off most weapon hits, sometimes even better than the rest of the hull. ",,,
#---- cruiser,,,,,
vanidad_almadena,SHIP,"The Almadena-class cruiser has a powerful frontal battery, a strong shield generator and the ability to boost its mobility when needed. As a general purpose ship it is always reliable at the center of a fleet.



The Almadena blueprint was recovered from the Debajo Del Sol station and quickly produced once the nanoforge was brought back online. Its performance against early threats of the VAO gave it a good reputation, even amongst ex-hegemony traditionalists. It is however not a very fast cruiser as unless its system is active, its engine assembly is locked at low power settings, to the bewilderment of many engineers. It is theorised that this was done to minimize maintenance costs.",,,
vanidad_viajero,SHIP,"A standard carrier of VAO design. Usefull in an escort role, it is one of the few ship that will carry lenador with them.",,,
vanidad_invasor,SHIP,Late VAO design. Very poor logistic profile as every part of the ship is focused on combat. With decend weapon position it prefers suporting closely a fighter complement over sending bombardment from afar.,,,
vanidad_cargador,SHIP,"The Cargador is an aggressive phase ship with a system that allows it to project a surprisingly potent wave of phase-adjacent energy, creating a significant EMP effect at the cost of its own dimension traversal capabilities. This ability allows it to prey on vulnerable ships or disable targets to help its allies in combat. It will falter without support however, as it lacks in point defense and most of its armament is focused on the front of the ship.

The Cargador is amongst the most advanced blueprints found in the decaying station of the Vanidad y Afliction Operation. Archeoengineer of the station tried for decades to study the strange device powering the vessel, but in vain. Modifications done during any part of the construction process of the blueprint invariably result in the catastrophic disassembly of the ship and of large section of its surroundings. Empirical knowledge is that the low frequency wave emitted will interfere with physical entities in a violent torrent unparalleled in most of the sector. While shield do stop it somewhat it seems to strain the flux grid, unlike conventional EMP weapon.

Native crewman of the planet below the station speak often with almost religious reverence of the spiral engine powering the ship, possibly due to its striking similarity to the underground reactors illuminating the ever darkness of their dwelling. Most other crewman tend to ask to be reaffected after more than a week on the Cargador for reason classified by the current hegemony backed authorities. This has made the ship a rare sight among the VAO's fleet.",,,
#---- capital,,,,,
vanidad_comandante,SHIP,"Comandante is the biggest ship found in the blueprint vault located on the Debajo Del Sol station. It has spectacular forward firepower and surprising mobility for ship of its size thanks to its temporal shell system. Unfortunately, this firepower cannot be sustained for long periods of time. 

Crews praise the Commandante for its performance on the battlefield for its temporal shell and firepower. In the dock however, the same crews curse its high maintenance requirements and confusing internal structure. The try tachyon corporation made many attempt to obtain a functional copy of this ship because of its system. Local engineer of the VAO seems to have been surprisingly tight-lipped or incapable of understanding it themselves as no information on the subject has filtered out.

Historian are unsure why such a large ship might have been designed yet unused by the Domain of man main military. Leading hypothesis is that it was used for a subfaction belonging to the domain but with different goals.",,,
#---- fighter,,,,,
vanidad_abogado_fighter,SHIP,"Multi purpose fighter able to damage fighters and frigates, quite sturdy. Has a hard time overcoming shield by themselves since they deal beam damage with small explosion. Cannot act as PD because of the intrinsect inacuracy of estarayo's weapons.

 It is a marvel of engineering to have sloted a fully functional light estarayo on a fighter frame. The dual barrel system manage to maintain the same per beam efficiency as the standard weapon. Inneficient vs larger vessel",,,
vanidad_lenador,SHIP,"The mining operation of Kristos contains many unique device to help the worker. The lenador is one of them, a massive mechanised suit meant to tear down transplutonic material. Inventive mind of the VAO noticed they were able to operate in space however. Small modification to their design allow them to participate in dismantling ennemy vessel. The civilian origin is easy to see however as they are very vulnerable to counter fire.",,,
#---- gun_estarayo,,,,,
vanidad_estarayo_light,WEAPON,"The Estarayo is a beam weapon created through detonating a flux charge inside of the weapon while firing, causing the beam to disperse in a violent explosion after reaching a certain distance. The peculiar charge loading mechanism does however cause rattling of the focusing lenses, which makes the beam quite inaccurate.



The full blueprint name is Estallido rayo, but the Archeoengineer did not manage to find a common translation among the natives of Kristos. Researchers are amazed at the ""vacuum based self-focusing"" that seemingly allow the beam to detonate, but no-one has yet been able to replicate it. Strangely however, the minimal distance required for this effect is unaffected by weapon settings, focus replacements, or any modern equipment that should alter the weapon range. In practice most crew like to call them exploding rays, and many a veteran spacer will tell you stories of a beam missing, only to suddenly explode behind their ships. 



The VA Operation uses this line of weapon extensively to suppress ships trying to vent, or to clear large groups of fighters. As it is deceptively deadly and poorly understood, it is one of the most restricted weapons manufactured by the VAO.",,,

vanidad_laere_small,WEAPON,"General multipurpose energy weapon. While better against armor compared to similar weapons, it suffers from a lower rate of fire and worse efficiency.

The LAERE seems to be an acronym for some physical phenomena, but most research data related to it was unrecoverable. The dual barrel design is quite disliked by maintenance crew, and does not at all follow conventional pulse weaponry despite performing quite similarly. Post-Collapse science is unable to prove if the underlying technology is similar at all. Researchers and historians alike seem to share the hypothesis that this line of weapons might have been created as an attempt to create a competitor to the venerable Pulse Laser and similar weaponry. An attempt that didn't work, seeing as it is not in use by most factions in the Sector.",,,

#Campaign,,,,,
#---- faction,,,,,
vanidad,FACTION,"Some time before the collapse, an undetermined faction started an operation in the Citlali system called Vanidad y Afliction. A large research station was built around a planet that was decided not to terraform and unique technologies were used to allow workers to stay on the planet and harvest the bountiful resources found there. The collapse ensured a quick end to it as it was isolated from normal domain colonies and wasn't self sufficient.

During the second AI wars, a disgruntled Hegemony officer discovered the dormant space station and decivilized survivors eking a subsistence alongside the massive churning machinery of their dormant planet. Seeing a chance, he reactivated the station and used the local inhabitant of the planet to restart the functional nanoforge and use all the blueprint abandoned here. While the lack of fuel and other resources limited the power of the faction he established, it forced the Hegemony to grant it a measure of independence. 

Time has passed however. While the elite, living in the slowly restored Debajodelsol station, are content with their affiliation with the Hegemony; the populace, still mostly living underground in the life supported habitat, has started to desire a greater independence. Dream of establishing themselves on more pleasant planet, or simply to embrace more fully the still untapped knowledge held in their research station has lead many to defy the current order of things.",,,
#---- planets,,,,,
vanidad_planet_kristos,CUSTOM,"A cold wasteland with surprisingly large ressources deposit. The planet was not meant to be terraformed and the Vanidad y Afliction Operation installed large underground habitat to give it a measure of independance. With access to a functioning if quickly damaged nanoforge, this allowed it to survive the collapse.",,,
vanidad_station_dds,CUSTOM,The reason the VA operation has autonomy. The gigantic station host a fully functional shipyard and vast pre-collapse research facility. The few living section that are not abandoned host the elite of VAO society far from the harsh planet below.,,"Micro-buoys guide your ship toward a well maintained dock. During approach, your view-screen fill with the massive side of the Debajo Del Sol station, most of it in variable state of abandon. A functionary, dressed in a way to immitate current hegemony trends, survey ship arrivals while guards dressed in the native hab-suit of Kristos try to look busy. 

Holo-display installed on the walls recite the obvious improvement to the life of the citizen since the now almost century old arrival of its ""savior"". Members of the current governing authority pays you no attention as they briskly walk by.",
vanidad_planet_arida,CUSTOM,"Never extensively settled during the Domain and abandoned shortly after the collapse, Arida is a hot, dry ball barely capable of supporting the agri-manors present upon its surface.  What water exists on the surface is funneled into these projects, and also sifted through to extract the paltry organics present within.
",,"Descending down through the clouds, the flat, parched plains of Arida stretch out on the view-screen as you dock at a clearly refurbished small-scale Domain era landing site.  Self-important functionaries bark orders at flinching serfs, their hab-suits festooned with awards and symbols of valorous service.  Traffic seems to mostly be one-way, with crates of food and organics stacked for shipment to Kristo, though there are equally as many laborers that seem destined to be shipped between the two worlds as needs require.",
