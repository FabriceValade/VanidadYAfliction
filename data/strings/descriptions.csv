#---- frigate,,,,,
vanidad_cazador,SHIP,"One of the early blueprint retrieved by archeoengineer from the massive space station  orbiting Kristo. The peculiar engine disposion allow it to reach surprising speed and agility. It is expensive to make and to maintain, but it is desired by those that desire speed and firepower.",,,
vanidad_forrajeador,SHIP,"The Forrajeador is a neat logistic package wrapped in an efficient defense platform. It is unlikely to win by itself against the more dedicated frigate, it is armed enought to justify is presence in small engagment. The iconic shape of the container, betraying the source of the blueprint, are a bit of an annoyance for port workers in most of the persean sector as they do not match standard domain specification.",,,
vanidad_pazjoya,SHIP,"This frigate is a nice all-rounder. Captain liek to use it as an escort, but its gun mount allow it to do grievous damage.",,,
#---- destroyer,,,,,
vanidad_halcon,SHIP,"An agressive destroyer frame, it seems to have been one of the latest developed before the gate system was shut off. Prized by captains for is ability to get in the face of other ship and fight it off. It, however, has poor coverage and dubious defensive abilities.",,,
vanidad_ionizador,SHIP,"Similar to the domain Sunder, some inner system are surprisingly similar leading a consensus about domain cooperation with whatever entity was responsible for the VAO project. Its turreted mount allow it to have remarcable coverage and to support engagement around it with ease. Crew are often worried about the front facing bridge, but the orange cristaline material that seems to be unique to VAO design is quite robust.",,,
#---- cruiser,,,,,
vanidad_almadena,SHIP,"Often used as fleet anchor by fleet commander, it was one of the most valuable blueprint recovered from the Debajodelsol stationa round Kristos. Powerfull front facing batteries joined to a strong generator allow a blistering offense and a ship that can hardly do wrong.",,,
vanidad_viajero,SHIP,"A standard carrier of VAO design. Usefull in an escort role, it is one of the few ship that will carry lenador with them.",,,
vanidad_invasor,SHIP,Late VAO design. Very poor logistic profile as every part of the ship is focused on combat. With decend weapon position it prefers suporting closely a fighter complement over sending bombardment from afar.,,,
#---- capital,,,,,
vanidad_comandante,SHIP,"The largest ship blueprint found in the debajodelsol station. Spectacular forward firepower and surprising mobility for a ship of this size. While impressive, it has a steep logistic cost and lack the flux to keep all its weapon firing for very long.",,,
#---- fighter,,,,,
vanidad_abogado_fighter,SHIP,"Multi purpose fighter able to damage fighters and frigates, quite sturdy. Has a hard time overcoming shield by themselves since they deal beam damage with small explosion. Cannot act as PD because of the intrinsect inacuracy of estarayo's weapons.

 It is a marvel of engineering to have sloted a fully functional light estarayo on a fighter frame. The dual barrel system manage to maintain the same per beam efficiency as the standard weapon. Inneficient vs larger vessel",,,
vanidad_lenador,SHIP,"The mining operation of Kristos contains many unique device to help the worker. The lenador is one of them, a massive mechanised suit meant to tear down transplutonic material. Inventive mind of the VAO noticed they were able to operate in space however. Small modification to their design allow them to participate in dismantling ennemy vessel. The civilian origin is easy to see however as they are very vulnerable to counter fire.",,,
#---- gun_estarayo,,,,,
vanidad_estarayo_light,WEAPON,"It is a self-focused ray produced by exploding capacitor. If given sufficient distance the short burst of energy creates large explosion. The peculiar charging mechanism rattle the optical focusing device however and the weapon is quite innacurate.

The full blueprint name is Estallido rayo, but archeoengineer ignore the meaning of it. In practice most crew like to call them exploding rays. Many a veteran spacer will tell you stories of missing beam suddently exploding behind their ships. 

The VA Operation uses this line of weapon extensively to supress ship trying to vent or to clear large group of fighters. This is the largest version found and the energy reached by the beam make the weapon surprisingly deadly, it is for this reason one of the most restricted weapon made by the VAO. ",,,
vanidad_estarayo_medium,WEAPON,"It is a self-focused ray produced by exploding capacitor. If given sufficient distance the short burst of energy creates large explosion. The peculiar charging mechanism rattle the optical focusing device however and the weapon is quite innacurate.

vanidad_laere_small,WEAPON,"General multi purpose energy weapon. Better at piercing armor than conventional pulse weapons, but lower overall damage and efficiency.

The laere seems to be an acronym for some physical phenomena. It perform quite similarly to convention pulse weaponry but it is unsure how the underlaying technology is similar. The original producer seems to have experimented with stronger form of copy protection and most part explode violently if dismanteled.",,,

#ship systems,,,,,
vanidad_redirect_power,SHIP_SYSTEM,"A special flux system cut down acceleration by 75% and top speed by 50% but The rate of fire of energy weapon doubles, their damage increase by 50% and their flux cost is halved.",,,
vanidad_hyper_stabiliser,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Flux Capacitor hypercharge the ship stabilitators, thus allowing all weapon range to be increased by 200 SU",,,

#Campaign,,,,,
#---- faction,,,,,
vanidad,FACTION,"Some time before the collapse, an undetermined faction started an operation in the Citlali system called Vanidad y Afliction. A large research station was built around a planet that was decided not to terraform and unique technologies were used to allow workers to stay on the planet and harvest the bountiful resources found there. The collapse ensured a quick end to it as it was isolated from normal domain colonies and wasn't self sufficient.

During the second AI wars, a disgruntled Hegemony officer discovered the dormant space station and decivilized survivors eking a subsistence alongside the massive churning machinery of their dormant planet. Seeing a chance, he reactivated the station and used the local inhabitant of the planet to restart the functional nanoforge and use all the blueprint abandoned here. While the lack of fuel and other resources limited the power of the faction he established, it forced the Hegemony to grant it a measure of independence. 

Time has passed however. While the elite, living in the slowly restored Debajodelsol station, are content with their affiliation with the Hegemony; the populace, still mostly living underground in the life supported habitat, has started to desire a greater independence. Dream of establishing themselves on more pleasant planet, or simply to embrace more fully the still untapped knowledge held in their research station has lead many to defy the current order of things.",,,
#---- planets,,,,,
vanidad_planet_kristos,CUSTOM,"A cold wasteland with surprisingly large ressources deposit. The planet was not meant to be terraformed and the Vanidad y Afliction Operation installed large underground habitat to give it a measure of independance. With access to a functioning if quickly damaged nanoforge, this allowed it to survive the collapse.",,,
vanidad_planet_arida,CUSTOM,"Never extensively settled during the Domain and abandoned shortly after the collapse, Arida is a hot, dry ball barely capable of supporting the agri-manors present upon its surface.  What water exists on the surface is funneled into these projects, and also sifted through to extract the paltry organics present within.
",,"Descending down through the clouds, the flat, parched plains of Arida stretch out on the view-screen as you dock at a clearly refurbished small-scale Domain era landing site.  Self-important functionaries bark orders at flinching serfs, their hab-suits festooned with awards and symbols of valorous service.  Traffic seems to mostly be one-way, with crates of food and organics stacked for shipment to Kristo, though there are equally as many laborers that seem destined to be shipped between the two worlds as needs require.",
